Hi, I'm MxAithne the WheeledNomad, I'm an Enby CripplePunk with Myopathic Ehlers Danlos Syndrome (EDS / mEDS) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) who lives a Nomadic Life.

I share tales of life as a Disabled person and part time Wheelchair user, who lives a semi Nomadic life. I shoot without a script, and keep my vlogs and stories short and ADHD friendly. I share vlogs, tales, tips, and how tos on my [YouTube channel](https://goo.gl/Nr5Sq7) and share photos, video, and tales on my [Instagram](https://goo.gl/4H2Bb2). You can also follow me on [Twitter](https://goo.gl/F5sK9x) or [Facebook](https://goo.gl/9L7qj9).<!--more-->

I'm a Queer Nonbinary person, I don't really identify as any gender, and my pronouns are fae / faer. I'm aestheticaly attracted to most genders, but am aromantic so don't have romantic relationships. I am also Intersex, specially I have Partial Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (PAIS) with Mosaic genetics.

## The Story of MxAithne the WheeledNomad

I've spent all of my adult life travelling in one form or another, my first home was a LDV Pilot van, from there I moved onto a much larger LDV Convoy and then bought and converted a Mercedes 209D Bus. I travelled thousands of kilometres a month, my life was about the adventure and kicking back and having fun. I picked up work as and when I needed it, either as a truck driver or a roadie.

Then in 2011 I became disabled and it grounded me for a few years. I was living in a flat for the first time in my life and it didn't suit me. I'm a nomad to my bones and can't live any other sort of life, above all else I am a nomad and I wanted my nomadic life back. As I learnt to live with my disabilities I started to be able to travel again. While learning to do this I found that the information out there for disabled travellers didn't suit my needs. As I'm sure I'm not the only disabled person who wants to travel and live a nomadic life  I'm sharing what I've found along the way.

## Why the Wheels?

I have [Myopathic Ehlers Danlos Syndrome (mEDS)](https://ehlers-danlos.com/eds-types/#mEDS), which causes me chronic pain and means that I'm not able to walk any real distance. While I'm a part time wheelchair user and can stand up out of my wheels and walk, it is at the cost of pain and the high risk that I'll collaspe. If I do collaspe I am unable to get back up, so my wheels are necessary most of the times that I'm out and about.

My condition also gives me chronic pain which I'm prescribed strong pain killers for, which can make travel difficult, and has resulted in some funny stories along the way.

## Checking My Privilege

I'm lucky enough to be a White passing European person. While my cultural background means that I have experienced my share of cultural harassment and phobia, it is not something that I usually experience based on the colour of my skin.

I am a part time wheelchair user, my ability to stand and walk for short periods of time gives me an advantage over some other wheelchair users.
