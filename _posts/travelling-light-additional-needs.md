If you look at a lot of solo travel or backpacking sites one of the big themes you'll pick up on is trying to keep the amount of kit that you take away with you as small as possible. Which I personally think is a good idea and a wonderful travel philosophy to aspire to. But it can be a little disheartening to read as a disabled person. But there are very good reasons as a disabled person to ignore this branch of abled travel advice.<!--more--> 

As disabled travellers we are almost always going to have to carry more kit with us, and that means having larger and possibly heavier luggage. I go into types of luggage and carry it in more depth in my writing about [Wheelchair Luggage](/articles/wheelchair-luggage/) or in the [luggage topic](/categories: [ posts ]
tags/luggage), so I'll skip over how, this is more about the why.

The main root of the philosophy of travelling as light as possible comes from two reasons:

- Having luggage treated as carry on rather than needing to be stowed
- Carrying / moving less weight around with you when you don't have a home base

## The Need for Carry On Luggage

If you're a wheelchair user this gets blown out of the water straight away, as any time you fly you're likely to end up having to put your wheelchair in the hold, so does it matter if your bag has to go with it?

It is similarly true of for luggage in overhead bins on lots of mass transport, while it's might be nice if all you luggage fits into that that space you have to be able to get up to the space in the first place. You're better off with a bag to stow and a bag with essentials in that you can keep comfortably on your lap. Provided you pack what you need in the right bag a tiny bag on your lap or under your seat beats having to dig through a larger pack.

## Carrying Less Weight

Carrying less weight is a good thing  to aspire to if you're a disabled traveller, as it will make travel simpler for you, and also hopefully make your luggage less bulky. There are many different ways you can save on the weight of your kit, the simplest and most obvious is to take less stuff with you. For a lot of people technology can be some of the bulkiest and heaviest items that they travel with and don't end up using. Look through the technology you take, can you live without it while you're travelling do you really need it? I will talk more about technology and travel in another article.

The next big thing to look at is clothes, as they can also be a major source of bulk and weight. Take what you need to cope with the weather conditions and the country that you're in, but also factor in the ability to wash clothes while travelling. It is quite possible to get by with a lot less clothes than most people travel with, it just means that you'll need to wash stuff from time to time. This is one where people say that guys have it a lot easier than us girls, but personally I don't think that's true. Layering and nice light weight top layers (personally I'm a big fan of skater dresses for travel) can give you lots of different outfits with a lot less clothes than you'd expect.

Medical supplies can be a major issue for disabled people and often one that they have no choice about. It's sometimes a good idea to talk to the prescriber of your equipment and supplies, to see if there are smaller / light options available. If you're an infrequent traveller it is often possible to get smaller equipment loaned or hired for the time you are travelling. If you're a more frequent traveller it is often worth looking into equipment that is easy to travel with, as it makes picking up and going much easier. But at the end of the day there are essential supplies that we need to travel with, if you can't make or get them smaller and lighter they become something you just need to travel with. It's something you learn over time and after a while you don't notice the extra that you have the others might not. I would never advise someone to leave behind medical supplies or equipment that they need, the important thing to have a good time when travelling, which you can't do if you're missing essentials.

## Is Smaller and Lighter Better

Yes, if you can achieve it, but it's not something to beat yourself up about. As disabled travellers we have additional needs, there is no point in putting yourself and your trip at risk in the hopes of packing small enough to impress strangers who feel the need to be fanatical about how little they can travel with. 

The best overall advice that can be given is to try and ignore what is said between non-disabled travellers and go with what works and keeps you well when travelling. It can feel disheartening if you look at some solo travel / backpacking forums, to the point of people bragging about how long they can live out of a 35 to 45 litre bag and sometimes very publicly criticising people who carry much larger bags. But it's always best to remember that they have much less challenging for travel than a disabled person does. Quite frankly while I've never been in the travel as light as possible camp, I've been an abled traveller and it is such a shift to travelling as a disabled traveller that most of those bragging probably wouldn't know where to start.

At the end of the day the important thing in all this is that you have enough to make your trip enjoyable, safe, and comfortable for yourself.

## Personal Experience

Personally I currently travel with a 35 litre main bag, a 15 litre under wheelchair bag, and a tablet sized lap bag, giving me a total of about 52 litres which by the travel light groups is a very large amount of luggage. Also it sounds like a lot of individual bags to manage but remember I have wheels with me so all of those bags are attached to my frame, they're not something that I have to hold myself.
