I have quite the thing for luggage and storage systems both in general and for use when I'm travelling, here I take a closer look at my own personal Everday Carry Bag (EDC). What I use, what I keep in it, and why, to give ideas for creating your own.<!--more-->

## Why?
The idea behind having an Everyday Carry Bag is to try and keep everything that I absoultly need close at hand. It's a little bigger than a wallet but smaller than a bag that I could put other items into.

I try and keep my Everday Carry Bag (EDC) as small and light as possible, so this is less of a bag and more my wallet / purse that carries everything that's really important to have on had. It has to be small and light enough that when I'm without my wheelchair I can carry it on me without causing a problem. My current bag is a LifeVenture{{< ncpr >}} Belt Pack (although never worn as a belt pack).

While the bag is called the LiveVenture Belt Pack I almost never carry it on my belt, it spends it's time either strapped to the back of my back rest or slung over my shoulder on a shoulder strap. So I've swapped the shoulder strap out from the 20mm that the bag came with to a much thicker 50mm strap as I find them a lot more comfortable to use. When I'm walking and having a good day I'll add a small amount of weight to the bag by detaching my LowePro{{< ncpr >}} Dashpoint 10 camera case from my wheelchair and addit it to the shoulder strap.

## What goes in the bag?

- Smart Phone 
- Debit Card
- Pre-paid Debit Card
- Passholder Case
	- Bus Pass
	- Railcard
	- Oyster PAYG Card (behind Railcard)
- Rainbow Clipper Lighter{{< ncpr >}}
- Sharpie Twin Tip Perment Marker{{< ncpr >}}
- Theme Park Pass + Companion Pass
- Eggshell Stickers & Art Trading Card Cards
- USB Thumb Drive
- Pill Storage

I try not to have loyalty cards in my day to day bag, as you quickly amass so many of them they start making a small bag very bulky and half the time I forget that they exist anyway. For those that I can I've moved them onto my phone, for those I can't I've almost stopped using them. If they add bulk and don't have an imeditate benifit to me I tend not to carry them around.

When I go out to clubs, pubs, or parties at night this further gets reduced to just my phone and pre-paid debit card stuff into my bra starp.
