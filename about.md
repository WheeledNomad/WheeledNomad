## The Story of WheeledNomad.eu

I've spent all of my adult life travelling in one form or another, from living out of a backpack to living in a self converted bus. Before I became disabled I regularly travelled thousands of kilometres a month, living on the concept that home was where I parked and it and picking up work when I needed it.

Then in 2011 I became disabled and it grounded me for a few years. I was living in a flat for the first time in my life and it didn't suit me, above all else I am a nomad. So I slowly started picking up travelling again, but I found that the information out there for disabled travellers didn't suit my needs. I was always a solo traveller, and without my own transport I am now a solo wheelchair backpacker. But all the information out there for disabled people and wheelchair users especially is aimed at package trips and staying in one place. Which didn't suit me, so I had to find my own way and I'm learning to be a wheelednomad. As I'm sure I'm not the only disabled person who wants to travel like anyone else is able to I'm sharing what I've found along the way.

While my circumstances have changed and I'll never be able to truly live a nomadic life again. I am still a nomad in my bones and live that way as much as I can.

## Who is MxAithne?

I'm a lot of different things, the labels that I'll mostly apply to myself are that I'm a queer, intersex, nonbinary, neuroatypical, cripple punk. But then labels are more for other people, I write a lot more about that means on [my personal site](http://mxaithne.eu/about). I have a passion for photography, writing, and generally being creative, which fits nicely with writing this site.

But above all that I'm a nomad, I hit the road at the age of 17 and didn't really look back from there. First living out of the back of a car and staying in hostels, B&Bs, and with friends. From there I converted my first van, an LDV Pilot, which was sadly short lived, but that went on to a a bigger LDV Convoy, until finally I bought my Mercedes 209D Bus. I'm partially grounded now due to my disabilities, but I'm not letting that stop me, I'm a nomad to my bones.

## My Disabilities

I don't really want to give a shopping list of my disabilities, as specifics of my conditions are personal. But it is useful to know how my disabilities affect my life and my ability to travel.

I have variable use of my limbs, especially under any sort of load, so I'm a part time wheelchair user. This does mean that I'm sometimes able to get up out of my wheelchair and walk a short distance. But at the cost of pain and the high risk that I will collapse and not be able to walk any further. So I almost always have my wheelchair with me, if I'm feeling up to walking I will use my wheelchair as a walker, but more often than not my health means that I am sitting on my wheelchair. 

My condition also gives me chronic pain which I'm prescribed strong pain killers for, which can make travelling more difficult.

Finally I'm neuroatypical, I have several different mental conditions that can make life quite interesting.

## Checking My Privilege

I'm lucky enough to be a White passing European person. While my cultural background means that I have experienced my share of cultural harassment and phobia, it is not something that I usually experience based on the colour of my skin.

I am a part time wheelchair user, my ability to stand and walk for short periods of time gives me an advantage over some other wheelchair using travellers.
