question: Why the Wheels?
answer: I have [Myopathic Ehlers Danlos Syndrome (mEDS)](https://ehlers-danlos.com/eds-types/#mEDS), which causes me chronic pain and means that I'm not able to walk any real distance. While I'm a part time wheelchair user and can stand up out of my wheels and walk, it is at the cost of pain and the high risk that I'll collaspe. If I do collaspe I am unable to get back up, so my wheels are necessary most of the times that I'm out and about.
