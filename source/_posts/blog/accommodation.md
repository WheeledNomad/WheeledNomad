If you read a lot of backpacking websites you'd be forgiven for thinking that to have adventures when travelling you need to stay in cool quirky hostels. Which can really daunting when you're a disabled backpacker as knowing that your accommodation is accessible to you is an important thing for making the trip. Despite what backpacking websites will have you believe you can have just as awesome an experience staying in chain hotels with perceptible accessibility as you can staying in completely inaccessible quirky hostels.<!--more--> 

## Hostels

Hostels are good if you like a social experience when you're travelling, but they're not for everyone, they can vary from perfectly accessible to completely inaccessible. A lot of the larger chains like the YHA<%- npr %> have accessibility information on their website, smaller ones tend to require phoning for accessibility information. Their cheap accommodation tends to be in dorms which will be either single or mixed gender, with single gender but shared facilities. While most offer private rooms, some even with en-suite these can be as expensive as a budget hotel room. But have the advantage of the social centres and self catering facilities that hostels have. 

I would say that hostels are a great choice if you are looking for a more social travelling experience. You need to be able to live in some shared space with people to be able to really appreciate them. For most it also helps be able to cope with the somewhat more party lifestyle of the other people you'll be sharing the common areas with.

## Hotels

Hotels tend to be the easiest bet for travelling while disabled, as most big hotels are fully accessible and will have plenty of information on their accessibility. They can be booked on line and normally communicated with entirely over email if you have problems with phones. You will find people who dismiss them as expensive but these days there are plenty of budget hotels that will do rooms from £30 a night upwards. The thing to watch out for with cheap nights is that they're in places that aren't as well travelled and / or on weird days of the week. Still if you shop around on line there are plenty of cheap bargains to be had and certain as cheap as getting a room to yourself in a hostel. The only real downside is that they can be few and far between in more out of the way areas.

Hotels are a good choice is you always need quiet private space, they tend be as cheap, if not sometimes cheaper, as a hostel's private en-suite rooms. But you'll need to make sure that you budget for food out while travelling or being able to live off snacks that you can bring back to your room.

### Aparthotels

Aparthotels are a fairly new thing they are more common in large cities, and offer a good half way point between the self catering of Hostels and the facilities of a Hotel. They can be on the pricey side for a traveller on a budget, but shopping around on line it is possible to get them as affordable rates. 

## Bed and Breakfasts

Before I talk about Bed and Breakfast type accommodation I have to admit that I have very little experience staying in them. This is due to struggling to find anywhere that is even basically accessible on trips that I have done. But I will share what experiences that I have but bare in mind that they are limited.

## AirBnB

AirBnB covers a wide range of different types of accommodation, from Hostels, to Bed and Breakfasts, to rooms to let, to the ability to let whole flats or houses. There is a facility on their website to filter accommodation by lots of different options and includes the option to filter for accessible accommodation. Which is great for disabled travellers as it gives 
The one big thing to remember is that unlike hotels each listing is written and tagged by the person who owns that accommodation, so everyone's idea of what is and isn't accessible varies. But I've always found people letting accommodation on there very helpful when I've messaged them at providing extra details and photographs to help me decide if somewhere is accessible to me. After all they want your money so it's in their interest to be helpful to you when you're trying to make a booking and asking questions about their accommodation.

I'm leaving aside ethical concerns about AirBnB, as some people have them some don't and it's up to each of us to make up our minds.
