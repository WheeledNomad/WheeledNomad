If you read accessibility blogs/forums you'll inevitably come across someone's angry rant about not being able to get on public transport because a buggy/parm was in the wheelchair space. The same is true if you look at parent/guardian blogs/forums you'll find equally angry rants about not being able to get on public transport because of a wheelchair. Given that I'm a wheelchair user you'd probably expect me to side with the wheelchair users rants and say that people with buggys or prams must always give them the space, but I don't.<!--more-->

**Both groups have equal need to use public transport**, while wheelchair users will argue that buggys / prams can be folded up it's a lot easier said than done. 

The thing is the transport companies are happy quite happy to sit back and let wheelchair users and people with buggys/prams argue amongst themselves over who has more right to the sole space they provide. As if they're doing that it stops people asking just why is there only one space on a vehicle. 

I've had people with buggys/prams offer to fold them up only to be told by drivers they don't have the time to wait. I've seen people left at bus stops because drivers where unwilling to wait the minute or so it takes them to manage taking everything off a buggy, folding it down, and storing it all safely on the bus all the while holding or supervising a small child. I've also been in the situation where I've offer to put my wheelchair in the luggage rack and been met with the same response of no time to wait the few seconds it would take me. All these times someone is denied access to that public transport. Having said that I've found this is more common with city buses where they'll be another one along in a few minutes. On country routes where it can be over an hour between buses drivers tend to be more accommodating. But all the time it's down to the driver to decide if they're going to be helpful or not.

Most buses, with the possible exception of the very short 30-ish seater ones, have the space to have both a dedicated wheelchair space and a dedicated buggy space. In most cases it means turning a second block of four forward facing seats into a set of three fold up seats. But there are very few bus companies that run buses like this, I think probably as they're not will to adapt to need and the adaptations would cost them money. 

It gets even worse when you get on to trains, most standard class train carriages have around 70 to 80 seats, with driver units being more like 40 to 60 seats. But again in a train consisting of multiple carriages there will only be one space that is shared between wheelchairs, buggyes/prams, and large luggage. It's not even one per carriage, on the long distance trains you can be on a train of 9 carriages that has one wheelchair or buggy space for the whole of standard class. There's normally a second space in first class, but you either need a first class ticket, which is expensive, or a accommodating train manager.

Again with trains like buses this bad design is passed back to the passengers who need to use the space to fight it out amongst themselves

So my real point, to both other wheelchair users and to people with buggys/prams, is why are we fighting amongst ourselves and not fighting for a better overall service?
