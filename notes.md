## Location

I'm aware at the moment this site is very UK centric, that will hopefully be expanded over the next few months and years as I relearn how to travel longer distances. As I typically travel by land expect my writings to start covering more of Europe over time as I travel it more. Hopefully at some point it will expand further than Europe but that will take time.

## Why some articles keep coming back to top of the list

Travel in general is constently changing and this is even more so for travel for disabled people. Articles will be updated as the information in them becomes out of date. Once they get updated their updated date will change and they'll come back to the top of the list of articles. Dates are only changed for major updates not minor ones, so usually it's worth a reread if something has been updated.

## Comments

You'll have probably noticed that there is no facility to comment on blog posts on this site, that is deliberate. This site is run as my hobby and I have a limited amount of time and energy that I can direct towards it, so I do not want to be loosing time spent working on my site dealing with the amount of spam that any site that has comments enabled gets nor with the inevitable flame wars that erupt between people in comments. While it would be possible to limit both of these by having some form of registration, either in the site itself or though a social media site that would mean opening the site up to having software that would track individual visitors, which is something that I do not want to do.

So if you wish to comment on a post there are a couple of ways you can do so:

- You can email me directly at WheeledNomad at gmail.com .

or

- You can replay the the appropriate facebook, tumblr or twitter post.

## Model of Disability

I use the terms disabled and disability a lot thought out the site, whenever I use this term I am using it in terms of the *Social Model of Disability*. As I'm not always so good at getting this in words I'm simply going to quote Wikipedia on this:

<blockquote>The social model of disability is a reaction to the dominant medical model of disability which in itself is a functional analysis of the body as machine to be fixed in order to conform with normative values. The social model of disability identifies systemic barriers, negative attitudes and exclusion by society (purposely or inadvertently) that mean society is the main contributory factor in disabling people. While physical, sensory, intellectual, or psychological variations may cause individual functional limitation or impairments, these do not have to lead to disability unless society fails to take account of and include people regardless of their individual differences.<br>

## NPR: Not a Product Recommendation

<%- npr %>

When talking about things in my blog I will often name the brand and model of what I use, this is to make it easier to understand what I'm talking about and to be able to look up a reference for similar items. Anything marked with NPR is not to be taken as a recommendation of that product over any similar product. I am not compensated in anyway by any of the companies / brands that I mention and am not endorsing their products and / or services, just merely using their existence as an example.

## NCPR: Non-Compensated Product Recommendation

<%- ncpr %>

Sometimes I will recomend a product or service that I use and like, and will tag those recomendations like this. I am not compensated in anyway by any of the companies / brands that I mention but I I am recomending their products and / or services.


## [Wiki] / [Ext]

<%- wiki('Wikipedia') %>

<%- ext('http://www.wheelednomad.uk/notes/#ref') %>

These are all used to detonate links to externial reference material, which would be otherwise cluttering up blog posts / pages, the text within the brackets gives you an idea of where the link leads. I will normally try to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia.org</a> where possible using the link [Wiki], as their articles are normally fairly well referenced and researched, but sometimes that's not possible so other sites may be used under the [Ext] reference.

## * Notes

These notes are specific to the blog post that they are part of, and should be listed at the end of the blog post.
